                Land investment refers to the acquisition of land as a long-term financial asset, with the objective of generating profit through appreciation, leasing, or future development. This type of investment is often considered stable and low-risk, especially in areas with high growth potential. 
                Investors may choose to hold land for future resale at a higher price, lease it for agricultural or commercial use, or develop it into residential, industrial, or infrastructure projects.
